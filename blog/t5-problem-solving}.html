    <h1><strong>Blocked on a simple problem</strong></h1>
    <strong>The problem?</strong><br>

    <p>When first came to New Zealand I couldn't find a job related to what I did in my home country</p>

    <strong>What problem solving techniques did you use?</strong><br>

    <p>I had to start with something, to overcome my language barrier and to start working, so I was asking friends for help, I used Google to find more information about job market in Auckland</p>

    <strong>How did you feel throughout the process?</strong><br>

    <p>I felt scared and not good enough</p>

    <strong>What did you learn?</strong><br>

    <p>I learned that when you scared you can't see your own advantages and strenght. The only thing you have to do is to follow your heart and keep working.</p>

    <h1><strong>Solved a problem in an elegant way</strong></h1>

    <strong>What was the problem?</strong><br>

    <p>Back to those days when I started doing quality assurance testing I had to attach a different kind of logs to my Bug report of a mobile app.</p>

    <strong>What problem solving techniques did you use?</strong><br>
    <p>As I've never done this before I decided to check other testers reports. Unfortunately there was no information about how to actually get the logs. Eventually I realised that I need to find them on my phone manually. So basically I google it and found
        a command that I needed to enter to open additional tools on my phone</p>

    <strong>How did you feel throughout the process?</strong><br>

    <p>I felt stuck at first, but the closer I was to find a solution the more excited I was.</p>

    <strong>What did you learn?</strong><br>

    <p>I learned that I can solve the problem on my own if I need to.</p>
