    <h1>What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?</h1>
    <p>
        The mindfulness is trainable, and if self-awareness is essentially mindfulness, then self-awareness must also be trainable in similar ways.
    </p>
    <h1>Try at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter (Body Scan, Journaling). What was your experience of it? How did you feel?</h1>
    <p>As soon as I read the description of a Journaling practice I reiised that this is what I've been doing for all of my life. I like to re-read my thoughts - it helps me to kinda aware myself from worries and excessive self-criticism.

    <h1>What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section?</h1>
    <p>
        I took a very important knowlege, now I'll try to hone that in my mind that thoughts and emotions are like clouds—some beautiful, some dark—while our core being is like the sky.
