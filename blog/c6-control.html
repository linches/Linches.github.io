        When programming, what are some of your triggers? What causes a disproportionate emotional response?
    </h1>
    <p>
        One of my main triggers is when programing I feel myself as a newbee almost all the time and every small issue I don't know how to solve looks as a big red warning button for me: "You cannot make it", "You know nothing", "Stop right there".

        How did you find the Siberian North Railroad exercise (Stop, Breathe, Notice, Reflect, Respond)?
    </h1>
    <p>
        Surprisingly, I've already practiced this type of exercise (or technique) in some situations in life. Although it needs to be practiced to master it and get advantages out of it.
