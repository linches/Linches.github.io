    <h1>which timebox and habits techniques did you try</h1>

    <p>
        As a person who struggles with the focus, I've started to use Pomodoro technique to see if I could stay focus on one thing at least for 25 minutes. But even that was a lot of time for me, as I was checking the timer from time to time and usually was distracted
        by not important stuff. Thereby I put a timebox for myself - 10mins of a constant focus, so I could start small
    </p>
    <h1>what did you find interesting?</h1>
    <p>
        I found interesting, that as I was practicing one or two techniques, which helps me to stay focus I added meditation too and actually changed my mindset from a fixed mindset to a growth mindset. And that changed my views to my own learning abilities.
    </p>
    <h1>what worked for you?</h1>
    <p>
        At the moment I'd say I see results only in one new habit I've learned and it is using Pomodoro technique and always check yourself how far did you go.
    </p>
    <h1>which will you experiment further with?</h1>
    <p>I'd love to experiment with "Display your ability first" technique. I wonder how it will work.</p>
