    <h1> Thoughts after reading chapter 2 of Search Inside Yourself</h1>
    <p> Before I thought that meditation is the perfect way to relax and spend some quality time with yourself After a few sessions I convinced myself with that, bat also I found myself a very distracted or even oblivious person. <br> I found that meditation
        helped me to stay more focused during the day or even during one task execution.<br> However the best finding about meditation so far was that the happiness is the default state of mind. I'd like to practise mindfullness meditation more to get
        to that state of mind.</p>
