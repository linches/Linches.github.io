    <p> I stick with phrase: "How you do anything is how you do everything". Isn't it the most motivational phrase ever?
    </p>
    <p> When you dance you don't think about moves you think about your feelings and how to express them. This is your goal. When you're coding your goal should be how to express the feelings through the code.
