    <h1>What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</h1>
    <p> Since the very first day I step into Auckland campus I felt like this is the place I want to be. "This is my experience, this is my Dev bootcamp.." "I'm going to blow my own mind by how much I will learn" - my almost exact thoughts. </p>
    <h1>What are your impressions?</h1>
    <p> I'd love to see friendly and supportive class of hungry for knowlege students, who will be studying side by side from 9 to 5 and even after. I am excited to learn more about coding and about people everyday </p>
    <h1> How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture? </h1>
    <p> I'd say perfectly well. I need smart people with burning eyes around me and I want to be the one who's eyes are burning creating something new. </p>
    <h1>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</h1>
    <p> Only two things that illuminated me. First of all I wasn't expected so much support during the preparatory phase. I feel more safe now "starting from the bottom". And second I reilised that I need to put all of my effort in to be a proud alumnus of
        EDA and to be proud of myself. </p>
